# Broken libs branch

This branch is a point-in-time before I removed the libraries that are broken and causing issues:

 * Issue #19 "mu does not include emacs by default"
 * Issue #13 "Ruby environment quite large..."
 * Issue #6 "39% of this repo is [unused] vimscript"

This branch exists so that I can some day retrieve these codes if I ever decide in the future to use the technologies that they configure.
